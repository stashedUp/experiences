# Can you recall a time of conflict with a coworker?
## Can you recall a time you disagreed with someone?

### Situation: 
- As a team lead, I sometimes have differing opinion than my manager
- My manager used to be a team lead, so he sometimes feel that know know the best way to deal with the issue
- My manager's approach is usually all sticks rather than carrots

### Problem:
- My manager wanted my team to always be responsive on Slack - somesort like a call center
- But I believe engineers need to focus, away from distractions
- Being always on Slack is a distraction 
- Distractions and partial focus would lead to suboptimal work
 
### Solution:
- I sat down and meet my manager on a resolution
- I told him  we need the engineers focus on their work with fewer distractions
- But he insisted that we should be reachable at all times
- I suggested that the "on-call" person of the week can take on the role of runner. That means if the dev team has unnplanned work, and when they ping my team on slack, the on-call person will respond
- I also suggested that the engineers use the focus emoji to let others know that they are in focus mode
- My manager was willing to compromise to that idea

### Impact:
- As an impact, with fewer distractions, my team felt they were much more productive 
- Their code reviews show fewer errors

### Lesson:
- I told my manager that I have to learn and grow from my own experience 
- I need to make my own mistakes and learn from them
- I should be able to experiment new ways and see what works or not
- The key here is to present your case from a logiacal perspective, do not let emotions or ego get in the way
- When I become a manager someday, I will in return let him or her try their own concepts/theories
