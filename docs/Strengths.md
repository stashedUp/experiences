# What are your strengths?

### Situation: 
- My biggest strength is my Logic and reasoning skills.
- I am able to take a complex idea and present it simply
- I am able to take an idea and find ways to present it as a solution
- I’ll paint you an example:
- When I became a team lead, one of my first tasks was to move our container cluster EC2 to Fargate.  
- That means moving our infrastructure from people managed to AWS managed. 
- We need to migrate because the cost of maintaining the old infrastructure will increase over time.

### Problem:
- The problem is that the product team’s manager does not want to change anything because the existing system works.
- In his point of view, he does not want to spend the time and effort to test the new infrastructure if we build it.

- When I was communicating the benefits of the migration to the product manager, I only talked about how my team can benefit and how it’s going to make my team’s life easier. 
- I couldn’t sell him on the idea.

### Solution:
- I later realized that I should not approach this from the standpoint of how I can benefit but how the development team can benefit.

- My team created a  spreadsheet that shows that in the long run, in terms of labor hours, we can save money if we use AWS managed resources. 

- My team brought up a mock environment and showed the development team the improvements we can see in terms of deployment time and manual security patching.

### Impact:
- The impact of this apparent, my team spent less time patching server and managing scaling while the development team benefited from shorter deployment times.

### Lesson:
- Although I am good at persuasion, I learned that persuasion involves many other soft skills such as:  
    - Communication
    - Emotional intelligence, 
    - Logic and reasoning, 
    - Interpersonal skills 
    - and most importantly negotiation.
