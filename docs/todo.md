Tell me about a time where you delivered a project late.
When was the last time you were unable to deliver within the timeframe originally specified?
Situation:
In this example, I am suppose to migrate a small application from the data center to AWS. This application is mostly used by an internal team. 

Problem:
Since I have migrated a couple of products in the past. I figured I would take a shorter time. So, then the Project Manager requested for a dateline. I provided an underestimated timeline. As I started working on the project, I realized that the team that I am working with does not have docker experience. So, they do not know how to contanerize their application. This is awhile ago - and this team were only used to building monolithic applications.

Solution: 
I ended up having to learn about their application, teaching them about docker and providing sample docker files. This wasn't enough. I also had to actuallly write their docker files - including create a small testing suite using docker compose. All this ultimately cost a lot of time and effor and I missed the dateline.

Lesson:
From this experience, I have learned not to be optimistic about setting dateline. I admit I was wrong and I should have communicated with the product team, understand their needs and technology shortcomings. Communication was key, and overconfidence can be detrimental. Going forward, I spent a lot more time understanding the product workflow, technology debt of the team I am working with and setting up realistic timelines. I rather be honest than provide a superficial timeline. 

Impact: 
So the impact from this experience is that, most of my future project have better dateline and I set better, more organized timeline for myself and my team in general.


What do you do when you have two conflicting priorities and can only deliver one on time?
What Would You Focus On: Fixing A Customer’s Issue Or Making A Great Customer Experience?

Situation:
I had a situation once where I had to chose between two priorities. The customer of a product we support are expected the release of a new feauture. On the infrastucture platform side, there was a bug that needed to be fixed and released.

Problem:
The customer wanted a new feature on top of what we already have for their application. But there was a bug with the operating system that we were using. I had to chose what I should work on immediately. 

Solution: 
I chose to work on fixing the bug first because it might have severe implication that we might not know of. Also, I think the customer trusted us with their information. I need to keep that trust. Otherwise, I am just adding more complexity to the existing complexity.

Lesson:
At the end of the day, we should always choose to protect the customer's information first, we should also maintain the existing features because that what drew our customers at the first place.


What happens when you realize you will be unable to deliver by the set deadline?

Situation:
In this example, I am suppose to migrate a small application from the data center to AWS. This application is mostly used by an internal team.

I also had to actuallly write their docker files - including create a small testing suite using docker compose. All this ultimately cost a lot of time and effor and I missed the dateline. I realized I won't be able to hit the deadline. So, I talked to my project manager and push the dateline to a later date. The product team also reliazed that they needed more help and they help me negotiate for a later deadline.

Lesson:
From this experience, I have learned not to be optimistic about setting dateline. I admit I was wrong and I should have communicated with the product team, understand their needs and technology shortcomings. Communication was key, and overconfidence can be detrimental.

Tell Me About a Time You Failed.
- talk about leadership
- free time - 20% (lots of discouragement from manager)
- gave up on it
- asked my manager that if I can at least try it one more time
- he gave the greenlight- tried it out -  it worked





If You’re Proud Of Something, What Would It Be?

What Would You Focus On: Fixing A Customer’s Issue Or Making A Great Customer Experience?

Situation:


Situation: Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. You
must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in
the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be
from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.


Task: What goal were you working toward?

Action: Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of
detail and keep the focus on YOU. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular
contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a
project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions.

Result: Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your
behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you
learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.
