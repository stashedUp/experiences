# Pixar

- When I think of Pixar, I think of creativity and curiousity. 
- When people think pf Pixar they sometimes think of one person with all the talent. 
- I've learn that creativity involves a large number of people from different disciplines working effectively together to solve a great many problem - especially if you're making movies
- At Pixar, I know that I  will have to maintain and develop at the same time. And I need to find time in-between to innovate.
- I would love to work in a place where I can meet passionate people from different departments and interact with them - a place where creative exchange of ideas happen. Not where people do the bare minimum.

- Coming from a Site Reliability Engineering background, I bring diversity to the team. I bring experience in not only writing code but also building, testing and deploying large scale software
- This includes my knowledge in linux internals and networking
- In my previous interviews, I have showed examples of how I have implemented standards and best practices in releasing software
- I am good at writing complex tools or services that help developers and system administrators
- I am passionate about this - I have written tools and services that do this at my current role, and I have demonstrated this ability in my open source projects that are used by developers around the world
- Iâ€™ve always enjoyed solving hard problems and at Pixar they solve hard problems. That's the itch I'm trying to scratch. At Pixar, I get the opportunity to solve hard problems.


- When I met Ryan (the hiring manager), he shared a story of how Bell labs, a telephone company, created the first transistor and indirectly contributed to the advancement of semiconductors. 
- It's hard to imagine a telephone company in 1947 playing a significant role in the development of computers that we see today. 
- I believe Pixar, a film company, will also play a significant role in the advancement of computers in the future. It would be incredible to be part of this future.
