# Pixar

- In the early 1990s, Pixar was known as the leading technological pioneer in the field of computer animation
- With more movies over the years, they push the technological boundaries of computer animation
- Unlike most other studios, Pixar never bought scripts or movie ideas from the outside. All of your stories, worlds, and characters were created internally by your community of artists

- When I think of Pixar, I think of creativity and curiousity
- When people think pf Pixar they sometimes think of one person with all the talent. 
I've learn that creativity involves a large number of people from different disciplines working effectively together to solve a great many problem - especially in the film industry
- When I see John Lasseter or Andrew Stanton, I see a whole team of people making a movie
- - I see the animators
- - The software engineers
- - The systems administators
- - The chef
 
- I know that the initial idea for the movie is merely one step in a long, arduous process that takes four to five years.

- Know that it's a on-going process, you will have to maintain and develop at the same time. You need to innovate in between.

- Creativity must be present at every level of every artistic and technical part of the organization

- I believe that community matters
- That takes trust and respect to get people to work effectively with one another, and it takes time to achieve this
- A communnity team setting, people are loyal to one another and their collective work, and everyone feels that they are part of something extraordinary
- I believe that their passion and accomplishments will encourage others to be creative and curious
- Here at Pixar you might get the opportunity to work alongside amazing people in places that pioneered computer graphics
- You want to be part of a workplace where creative exchange of ideas happen. Not where people do the bare minimum. 
- I want to work in a place where everyone is fully invested in helping everyone else turn out the best work. Where they really do feel that it’s all for one and one for all
- I would like to work in a place where I can meet people from different departments and  interact with them - a huge common area - like a cafeteria
- Put smart, passionate people in a room together, charge them with identifying and solving problems, and encourage them to be candid


### Cross-collaboration
- Cross-team collaboration discipline is not a one-off thing. It is an ongoing process that needs to be a part of the company’s work culture.

- Align project goals and share them with everyone
- - When there is a lack of clarity and alignment in the team, you will start seeing even more problems when you try to break the work down into different tasks and assign them to the members.

- - Each team member would handle the task with a different goal in mind, which will eventually lead the team to nowhere

- - To avoid situations like these, it is important for cross-functional teams to discuss the important goals before starting the work and make sure they align with the overall company goals as well as the goals set up by the different departments.

- Establish a centralized communication method
- - make sure there is a centralized way for teams to communicate. Communication is one of the most important parts of any type of cross-team interaction. Without good cross-team communication, collaboration falls apart

- Assign a single point of contact for each team - Establish structure at the very beginning
- - ensure there's only one contact person on both sides. This avoids confusion on different directions from the client, eliminates overlap of tasks, and helps in managing expectation

- Promoting diversity
- - Diversity, of any kind, is a positive element to teamwork. 
- - With an assortment of different professional experiences and skill sets on hand, it can provide the necessary tools and paths to tackle the problem in an inventive way.

- Eliminating tribalism (tribal knowledge)
- - Tribalism within the workplace can be damaging to companies, and kill off any chance of a cross functional collaboration strategy.

- Don’t be afraid to experiment
- - Cross-functional teams come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, which means there will be all sorts of methods that will help boost collaboration.
- - So, when it comes to finding the perfect formula for your team, remember it’s all about trial and error.

- Celebrate as a Team
