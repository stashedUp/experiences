## How do you handle feedback?

### Situation
Being a software developer, when you work for a company, the code you write does not belong to you. It belongs to person who paid you. Code is a “product.” Your task was to deliver the best code possible. But I do have short comings and blind spots. 

When I wrote code with the programming language that I am most comfortable with. In my case, I wrote in bash. I knew other languages, but for this instance, I mostly wrote in Bash. That's because most scripts are easier to run on jenkins. 

### Problem/Task:
 - While it was easy to script in Bash. It was not always easy for newer developers to understand Bash. 
 - I had many young developers in my team. My manager saw the younger developer struggling and suggested that I pick an easier language for the younger developers. 
 - Initially I disagreed with him because I thought the younger developers need to learn bash to keep up. It later hit me that my previous manager forced bash on me. And at that time, I didn't agree with him either.

### Solution/Action: 
 - Seen in that light, I decided to change my approach. I still felt that we should have some sort of standard and uniformity but maybe we should extend it to 3 languages. That way the hurdle or burden of entry is not too earl.

 ### Result
 - As a result, newer developers can contribute sooner. 
 - Also, it make work fun since they feel like they are adding value to the company

 ### Lesson
 - It's important to see from the other point of view
 - See why developers are struggling
 - Treat everything as an experiment. There are no failures only failed hypothesis. We keep trying and experimenting until we get the desired outcome.
