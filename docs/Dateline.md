# Tell me about a time where you delivered a project late.
# When was the last time you were unable to deliver within the timeframe originally specified?
# What happens when you realize you will be unable to deliver by the set deadline?

### Situation:
In this example, I am suppose to migrate a small application from the data center to AWS. This application is mostly used by an internal team. 

### Problem:
Since I have migrated a couple of products in the past. I figured I would take a shorter time. So, then the Project Manager requested for a dateline. I provided an underestimated timeline. As I started working on the project, I realized that the team that I am working with does not have docker experience. So, they do not know how to contanerize their application. This is awhile ago - and this team were only used to building monolithic applications.

### Solution: 
I ended up having to learn about their application, teaching them about docker and providing sample docker files. This wasn't enough. I also had to actuallly write their docker files - including create a small testing suite using docker compose. All this ultimately cost a lot of time and effor and I missed the dateline.

### Lesson:
From this experience, I have learned not to be optimistic about setting dateline. I admit I was wrong and I should have communicated with the product team, understand their needs and technology shortcomings. Communication was key, and overconfidence can be detrimental. Going forward, I spent a lot more time understanding the product workflow, technology debt of the team I am working with and setting up realistic timelines. I rather be honest than provide a superficial timeline. Without a realistic deadline, the team can feel burnout and deliver subpar work.

### Impact: 
So the impact from this experience is that, most of my future project have better dateline and I set better, more organized timeline for myself and my team in general.
