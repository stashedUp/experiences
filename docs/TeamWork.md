# Team Work

# Have you ever found it difficult to work with a manager or other team members?

### Situation:
- A year ago, we had a change of manager
- I personally don't have a hard time
- I am quite a social person
- I have often worked with managers and coworkers, and I rarely find it difficult.


### Task: 
- Goal is to make my team feel less treaten of the new manager

### Action:
- In order to make my team work better with the manager, I used to invite th manager to our smaller meeting (He was mostly an observer)
- If I organized a social activity, I invited my manager as well

### Lessons:
- Sometimes it takes some time to adjust to a new manager or leader in a team environment. 
- However, as long as we take the time to connect and clarify expectations, I think everything will work out. 
- I expect an adjustment period, just like any other relationship.

# When was the last time you enjoyed working as a team? When was the time you did not enjoy the team?

- I was not start with a time where I did not enjoy working in a team and what was the factors

- In my former team (5 years ago), there was a lack of leadership
- I felt like there was lack of communication between developers and sre
- People didn't feel motivation
- There was no end goal
- People came to work and didn't the bare minimum
- There was nothing to be excited about (no motivation)


- NEW TEAM
- We worked towards a common goal
- There was clear leadership from the manager 
- The manager checked in with me and I  checked in with my team and with individuals on a bi-weekly basis. 
- My manager trusted us, but also cared about our work.
- I all felt invested in the project because leadership showed their own investment
- People did more than the bare minimum
- Felt like we were on a mission
- Cross-collaboration between developers and devops was phenomenal - it flet like we were working towards a bigger goal
