Tell Me About a Time You Failed.
- talk about leadership
- free time - 20% (lots of discouragement from manager)
- gave up on it
- asked my manager that if I can at least try it one more time
- he gave the greenlight- tried it out -  it worked


If Youâ€™re Proud Of Something, What Would It Be?


### Experiment
 - Treat everything as an experiment. There are no failures only failed hypothesis. We keep trying and experimenting until we get the desired outcome.
