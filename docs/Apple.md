# How you would contribute at Apple

- I understand the scope of this role. I will be helping build APIs for developers within Apple to access the storage system.
- Coming from a Site Reliability Engineering background, I bring diversity to the team. I bring experience in not only writing code but also building, testing and deploying large scale software
- This includes my knowledge in linux internals and networking
- In my previous interviews, I have showed examples of how I have implemented standards and best practices in releasing software
- I enjoy developing tools or services that help developers and system administrators
- I do this at my current role at Pearson, and with my open source projects 
- At Apple, I know that I  will have to maintain and develop at the same time. And I need to find time in-between to innovate.
- During the interview, I enjoyed talking to the engineers from different departments. They all seem passionate and eager to help. I cannot wait to work at a place where creative exchange of ideas happen. Not where people do the bare minimum
- Iâ€™ve always enjoyed solving hard problems and at Apple they solve hard problems. That's the itch I'm trying to scratch. In this role I get the opportunity to solve hard problems.

# How you take initiative and drive projects forward

- As engineers, we break things and put them together. 
- I am always curious if we can take apart something complex and make it better. 
- I am someone who embraces the culture of experimentation. I treat everything as an experiment - there are no failed experiments, only failed hyphothesis
- If things don't work, we change the parameters and try again. I consider myself as a creative person. 
- I push myself to think out of the box and try to see things from different angles.

- These 3 traits make me care about the code I am writing. To show initiaitve, you must first care about the work you are doing. 

- I hate the concept of the one man army - where one person builts the entire codebase and everyone else is suppose to simply use it. What happens if this person leaves the company or gets hit by a bus. 

- I also hate the concept of tribal knowledge. 
- Tribalism within the workplace can be damaging to companies, and kill off any chance of a cross functional collaboration strategy.

- When I take initiative, I incorporate the entire team. I have a workflow that I follow and make sure that my entire team in involve. I delegate task to encourage participation.

# There are 3 traits that define me

### curiosity 
- As engineers, we break things and put them together, I am always curious if we can take apart something complex and make it better
- I am curious to learn about how things work even if it's not related to my domain
- I apply this sense of wonder and curiousity in my daily software industry life

### experimentator 
- I don't know if this is the right term - but someone who embraces the culture of experimentation
- I am willing to try and fail, rather than not trying at all
- I treat everything as an experiment - there are no failed experiments, only failed hyphothesis
- If things don't work, we change the parameters and try again

### creativity
- I push myself to think out of the box and try to see things from different angles
- I enjoy meeting people with different backgounds and see how differently they approach similar problems
- I truly believe innovation is when arts meets engineering
