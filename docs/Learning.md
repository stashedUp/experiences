# Learning a large code base


### Read the Documentation
- reading over any available documentation or README file.
- This allows me to become familiar with the setup, functions, style, and other important parts of the codebase.

### Pairing
- pair with a developer on your team who is more familiar with the codebase. 
- This person can provide high-level insight about particular design patterns, testing, processes, and third-party code that are relevant to the project.
- They can also give you more historical context about the project and why certain choices were originally made

### Start with the Smallest Part
- I look at a line of code in the file that I already understand. 
- From there, I keep moving to figure out the related lines of code that I donâ€™t know so that, eventually, I can make sense of the entire piece.
- Volunter to make small changes - get comfortable with Merge Requests

### Debugging Session
- When a fellow developer is debugging a problem, join in the session to see what they are troubleshooting


### Take a course online
- If I am unfamilar with the language, I will sign up for a class
- Read the book or watch youtube tutorials
