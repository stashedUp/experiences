# Improve the way we do things

I enjoy developing tools that would help developers and systems engineers with their day-to-day work.
Day to day, we encounter gaps within our workflow. Often times, people take manual steps to fill this gaps.
Say you want all developers to use a certain version of a software
Or, when you deploy code, you need to run several automated test 
Or, you need a way to centralize logs for all products in your portfolio
- how would you accomplish this. 
How do you roll out a systemmatic, consistent pipeline of delivering software?

I develop tools to bridge the gap - that missing piece.

# Automation
- When you’re not automating the process, you’re creating manual one. These manual steps usually require communication from a person to another. 
- As the path of communication gets wider, the original set of instructions or documentation are misinterpreted, miscommunicated, and not maintained.
- Computers, on the other hand, are way better at running repetitious tasks accurately. We should write scripts to automate any manual process in our release process. 
- Commit the automation script in source control for other developers to collaborate and improve the process.

# Documentation
- My old manager who had since retired used to say: What if you get hit by a bus the next day? 
- I am a big fan of doumentation and keeping up with documentation. 
- In my opinion, code is only complete with good documentation
- Anyone should, in any region of the world should be able to read your documents and understand what's happening
  - this includes diagrams, images or even videos

# Leadership
- At Pearson, I am not only developing code but also leading a team
- I hate the culture of one-man-army where one person has the knowledge of the software since he is the only person that wrote it. I think a good software if never final. It's always evolving. And is should. But it must be a collborative effort. Where ideas are opposed and agreed upon. 
- I also don't encourage tribal knowledge. This is when a particular skill set is only shared among a group of people. As a leader, I hate passing of a information. This is where I encourage documentations and healthy debates.
- As a leader, I also want to enable others to innovate (not just for myself). I want to create a culture of experimentation where people can try and fail. I do this a lot with my team. 
- As a lead, I experimented a 

# Deploying through the pipeline involves three main phases:

1. Building the infrastructure — provisioning and managing the environment in which your software will run
2. Installing the software and its dependencies — installing the correct version of the software into the infrastructure
3. Setting up configuration for software — configuring your software and database, including any data or state it require

# What are you lacking and what are you looking for?

We are looking for software engineers committed to building state of the art production tools for our artists. Our Platform Software Engineers are responsible for helping craft and maintain new software for Pixar's asset system, production pipeline and software development infrastructure.
Do you have a deep understanding of software application engineering, an ability to collaborate in a large multi-functional team of developers, and skill in designing and implementing reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems?
