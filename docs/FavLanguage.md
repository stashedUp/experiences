# Piece of trivia about your favorite language

- The language of my choice is Golang
- It was developed by Ken Thomson, Rob Pike and Robert Griesemer in 2009
- I started learning Go in 2014. Although people say that Golang is very useful for writing light-weight microservices.
- What I **like MOST about go** is that you can compile the binaries for multiple OSes and Architectures on the same machine. 
- This is helpful when I am developing open-source tools that can be easily downloaded on any machine.

- For example: My twitch project
- My second favorite thing about Go is the ease to write programs that utilizes concurrency

- For example: My health-check project
- What I **dislike MOST about GO** is the lack of built-in libraries. 

- For example, to use a queue or stack, you have to implement if from scratch
- Another thing **I disliked about GO** was how they used to manage library dependencies. Overtime they improved this with `go mod`
- It’s nice to see the language you like evolve to what you have now. It’s like watching a pet grow.
