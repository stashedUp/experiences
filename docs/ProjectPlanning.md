# Project Planning

## How do I take an idea to a solution?


## Lets take an example from one of many implementions

### Problem
- The development team deploys code every two weeks
- Each time they deploy there are several key steps that they have to take
- for example
- take manual shot of the current database
- disable replication of db
- check nothing is in job queue
- no incomming request
- the development team runs these checks manually
- people have to communicate with each other to accomplish these task
- it can become very messy
- It's prone to human error

### Solution
- automate all the steps
- create multiple multiple parallel job with dependencies instead of a linear pipeline

## How do I methodically approach this? 


- I do not want a one man army doing all these task
- Avoid tribal knowledge
- I need to methodically break the pipeline into smaller task
- I need to delegate work to myself and my peers

The approach I have used is the Agile methodology

(on Sprint Planning)
- I work with the Project manager, we define the scope of the project
- I create Isolate tasks within the project
- My team and I design time-based objectives - we decide how long each task take - we assign points
- I work with my team to delegate the task
- Move task into our sprint board - set a goal for the sprint
- Start the sprint
- Make adjustments to ensure success

(daily standup)
- I talk about my progress
- Blocks
- What else I have to do

(deploy)
- deploy changes
- push new features

(Iterate)
- Go back to the drawing board when outcome fails to meet expections
- Work on the problem again after recieving feedback from end user


## Key takeaway
- Treat everything as an experiment
- We test hypothesis
- I focus on people, prototypes, collaboration, and iteration
- People - Am I stuck with my work, do I need help. How about my coworkers
- Output - Do we have a minimum viable product, a prototype for feedback
- Cross-funtional collaboration - What is the feedback from the end users? 
- Back to the drawing board - lets get it working, lets iterate

### Personal Capacity
- Personal productivity
- set meetings for collaboration
- Prioritize tasks 


### Quarterly milestone
- Product road map 
- goals 1,2 ,3 ...

SAY I took initiate to do this sort of project meeting. I got promoted to a team lead because I was able to write code and navigate my team as well
