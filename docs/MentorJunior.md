# How do you mentor junior employees?

### Situation:
- My passion has always been teaching. I enjoy teaching.
- In fact, I’ve consider being a professor when I retire
- Before I became a team lead, I had to show my managers that I am capable of teaching, training and mentoring junior to senior level employees that joined my team. 

### Problem:
- My team supports 3 major products and we are busy all the time. 
- It’s not possible to simply handover work to new members. 
- And, it’s not easy to dedicate time to simply go over everything

### Solution:
- The best way to solve this problem was to include the new member when any of us are debugging something. 
- Say you are trying to figure out why the health check is failing. 
- As you debug, I told my team to include the new team member on a call. 
- Other times, we let the new team member watch us make a change in one of the lower environments and ask the new member to perform the change in other lower environments.
- I think the best way to learn is by doing - especially in the lower environments.

### Impact:
- If done right, you can see the impact within 3 weeks.
- The goal is to have the new team member add value as fast as possible.

### Lesson:
- One lesson to take away is that, you should have a lot of patience while training new members. 
- A crucial part of mentoring is breaking things down into its simplest form. 
- You have to always think from the person’s point of view and assume they don’t know.
