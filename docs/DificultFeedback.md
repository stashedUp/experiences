# Tell me about delivering difficult feedback to someone on your team.

### Situation:
- For this question, I am going to give an example of how a fellow team member was either  frequently late or absent from our meetings, and what I did as a team lead to rectify it. 

### Problem:
- One of my teammember sometimes misses meetings or shows up late to meetings. 
- As a result, most of us end up either waiting for him or having to repeat the minutes of the meeting to him. 
- In the past, when we have a team member that does not show up, the management uses the stick approach. 
- I hated that approach. 
- I wanted an approach based on understanding.

### Solution:
- In my team, when a person misses or shows up late, the first thing I usually ask that person is if everything is okay. 
- This shows that I am concerned about the person. Instead of assuming that person did not care, I assume that the person missed or did not show up because something major had happened to them.
- For example, I first say, “Hey I saw that you showed up late. Is everything okay with you?”
- Usually they say something like, “Sorry, I had to drop off the kids” or “Sorry, I overslept”. 
- I proceed to tell them that I understand but I need them to see the consequences of their actions from our point of view. 
- For example, I say, “I understand, but I want you to understand that the entire team had to wait 5 minutes until you are there”
- I usually advise that it’s okay if you are going to be late or miss a meeting. 
- But it’s crucial that you inform the team on slack so that we can carry on without you. Things happen, we understand.

### Impact:
- As a result of this approach, most teammates announce clearly when they will be late or will not show up. 
- Most of the time, they show up because constantly posting that you’re going to be late -looks bad.

### Lesson:
- One lesson to take away from this is that not every bad action needs a stick approach.
- Sometimes, we have to come from a place of understanding. 
- Coming from a place of understanding promotes  camaraderie and a sense of belonging towards the team.
