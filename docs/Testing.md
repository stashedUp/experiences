# Testing

# Test Driven Deployment

- The problem is that tests must change as the production code evolves. 
- The dirtier the tests, the harder they are to change. 
- The more tangled the test code, the more likely it is that you will spend more time 
cramming new tests into the suite than it takes to write the new production code. 
- As you modify the production code, old tests start to fail, and the mess in the test code makes 
it hard to get those tests to pass again. So the tests become viewed as an ever-increasing liability.



- If you donâ€™t keep your tests clean, you will lose them. 
- And without them, you lose the very thing that keeps your production code flexible. 
- It is unit tests that keep our code flexible, maintainable, and reusable. 
- The reason is simple. If you have tests, you do not fear making changes to the code!
