# Describe a Time You Had to Make a Difficult Decision

### Situation: 
- When I became a lead, I had a team of 5 engineers including myself. 
- We were almost always busy. 
- One of my teammates was not performing up to par. That person was lagging behind and made many mistakes that usually lead to bigger problems. 

### Problem:
- This became a problem because someone else had to verify this person’s work all the time. 
- It’s as if two people were working on the same problem.
- This causing others to get frustrated because they had to clean up or refactor code. 
- This was unnecessary work. 

### Solution:
- I talked to this person several times and made this person keep a notebook with the notes he had learned daily. 
- I designed a project where this person had to work on without anyone’s help. 
- Since this person had worked on this before, this person should know how to solve it. This is similar to a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). 
- I wanted to give this person enough time to prove themself.

### Impact:
- At the end of the day, the person still did not meet my teams standard. 
- My manager and I made the decision to let him go. 
- We were able to hire someone better shortly after.

### Lesson:
- The lesson learned here is a difficult but important one. 
- At the end of the day, we are supporting a business, charity can only get you this far. 
- I can put all the effort I want to keep this person, but at the end of the day it’s up to this person to show up.
- It’s easier to cut our losses sooner and move on, rather than drag on.
