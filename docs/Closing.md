# Closing Statements



I see this as an opportunity to contribute to a forward-thinking company that is not only customer-experience driven but also engineering driven.
Iâ€™ve always enjoyed solving hard problems. Apple hires the best engineers to solve hard problems. It would be an honor to be part of a company that does that. 

The only thing that I truly lack is opportunity. If you give me that, then I promise you, you'll never regret it.
