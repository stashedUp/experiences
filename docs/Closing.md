# Closing Statements



I see this as an opportunity to contribute to a forward-thinking company that is not only customer-experience driven but also engineering driven.
Iâ€™ve always enjoyed solving hard problems. AirTable hires the best engineers to solve hard problems. It would be an honor to be part of a company that does that. 

Also, I want to be involved in something that would have significant impact on the world. At Airtable, I know I will have the opportunity to invent something new that has never been invented before. With my drive and curiosy, I know I can bring AirTable to the next level. 

The only thing that I truly lack is opportunity. If you give me that, then I promise you, you'll never regret it.
