# What do you do when you have two conflicting priorities and can only deliver one on time?

## What Would You Focus On: Fixing A Customerâ€™s Issue Or Making A Great Customer Experience?

## Tell me about a time you had multiple responsibilities to manage. How did you respond to this situation?

### Situation:
I had a situation once where I had to chose between two priorities. The customer of a product we support are expected the release of a new feauture. On the infrastucture platform side, there was a bug that needed to be fixed and released.

### Problem:
The customer wanted a new feature on top of what we already have for their application. But there was a bug with the operating system that we were using. I had to chose what I should work on immediately. 

### Solution: 
I chose to work on fixing the bug first because it might have severe implication that we might not know of. Also, I think the customer trusted us with their information. I need to keep that trust. Otherwise, I am just adding more complexity to the existing complexity.

### Lesson:
At the end of the day, we should always choose to protect the customer's information first, we should also maintain the existing features because that what drew our customers at the first place.
