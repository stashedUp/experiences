# Walk me through your resume? Tell me about yourself.

- [SCHOOL] I actually went to school for Actuarial Science. My parents wanted me to be an Actuary. 
- While in college, I enjoyed building websites and writing programs for fun. 
- I learned how to code by reading a book. It’s probably uncommon these days. 
- My advisor suggested I add computer science to the list of degrees. My mom advised me to get serious about my life and be an actuary. But I am glad I followed my passion and chose to be a software developer. 

- [SOFTWARE ENGINEER] I joined Pearson as a backend Software Engineer. At that time, we were still in the data center. 
- A year later, I heard that we were moving to the cloud. I had a lot of ideas about how we should build our infrastructure. 
- Rather than working as a developer, I wanted to build a better infrastructure. 
- I know that if I join the devops team then, I could catch the wave. 

- [DEV OPS] In the DevOPs role, I moved our application from the data center to AWS. 
- I also moved our application into a container. I pioneered the use of containers at Pearson. 
- The infrastructure that I built became a model for other products at Pearson.

- [SRE] A few years later, I was at a conference and I learned about distributed systems and microservices. 
- I proposed to my manager that we should sit with the developer, understand their workflow and build the infrastructure with the development team. 
- Right about that time, Pearson transitioned me to a SRE role. 

I am glad I found my calling early, I’m glad did not play it safe, instead I was a little bit swashbuckling
