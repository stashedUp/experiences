# Walk me through your resume? Tell me about yourself.

- [SCHOOL] I actually went to school to study Actuarial Science.
- My parent wanted me to be an actuary.   
- While in college,I took several CS classes and really enjoyed it. 
- When I graduated I had an acturial and computer science degree.
- WHen it came to pick a job, I chose to be a software engineer
- My parents used think I fix computers & printers all day. 
- Years later, my dad called me and asked me if I knew what an algorithm is 
- I guess he figured out that I write computer code

- [SOFTWARE-ENGINEER]I joined Pearson as a backend Software Engineer. At that time, we were still in the data center. 
- Later, I heard that we were moving to the cloud. I had a lot of ideas about how we should build our infrastructure. 
- Rather than working as a developer, I wanted to build a better infrastructure. 
- and I was interested learning linux and networking

- [DEV-OPS] In the DevOPs role, I moved our application from the data center to AWS. 
- Once, at a conference and I learned about microservices and containers.
- I decided to experiment by taking a product that I manage and move it into a container.
- I revamped the pipeline and rebuild the build job to include functional testing with docker-compose
- The infrastructure that I built became a model for other products at Pearson.

- [SRE] A few years later, I was at another conference and I learned about distributed systems. 
- I proposed to my manager that we should sit with the developer, understand their workflow and build the infrastructure with the development team. 
- Right about that time, Pearson transitioned me to a SRE role.Â 
- Right now I am team lead, I do mixture of coding and leading. And a lot of teaching and mentoring. I set long term goals and make sure that my team is on the right path
