# Why Leave?

## What are you planning to leave your current company?

- I’ve worked for Pearson for 9 years. 
During my tenure here, I have learned great deal about software development and how to release software. 
- When I first joined the DevOps team, I was involved in moving things out of the data center to AWS. 
- I helped pioneer my company’s first microservice infrastructure. I've seen us evolved from the data center to a cloud based infrastructure
- However after 9 years, I feel like I’ve learned everything I need to know at my position. I want to expand myself and seek bigger challenges
- I am hoping that my next position will have more impact towards a larger audience. Especially with the products that I am building
- I am also seeking opportunities for leadership, which is critical in my career goals
- And, that's why I am leaving
