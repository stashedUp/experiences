# Day-to-day

## What do you do at my current position?

- I design and architect the infrastructure after gathering the requirements from the developers and product owners. 
- I work closely with the development team. I try to understand their end goal and their workflow. With that, I work on a solution that optimizes the infrastructure where we can scale and remain reliable 
- I design the infrastructure so that applications can automatically recover from failure 
- I do all these while keeping the operating cost in mind
- Next, I build and codify the infrastructure using terraform - Terraform
- I create the pipelines on Jenkins to deploy the application
- I set up alerts and monitoring for the application. This will alert my team if the application or AWS resources  is down or when resources reach a certain threshold 
- I need to make sure I protect data in transit and at rest. Pretty much keeping people away from data.
- I also have to prepare for security events. For example the zero-day log4J vulnerability that happened last year
- I work SLOs and budget for errors with the product manager
- I also write or create custom tools to automate or improve existing processes using go as my primary language
- As a team lead, I set long term long term goals and make sure that my team is on the right path
