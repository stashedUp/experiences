# Describe a time when you felt you were being treated unfairly at work. What was the situation and how did you respond?

### Situation: 
- When my team had a new manager, the manager did know anything about the team they were manging.
- The team was disarray and they was poor planning on the leadership
- I expected some sort of transition to the new manager

### Task:
- My goal was to get back the team on a regular cadance
- I decided to be a defactor leader

### Action:
- I distributed work among the team
- I also worked with the new project manager to add stories to the Jira board 
- I answered all the questions when the product owner had questions
- I was the "senior member that knew what was happening"

### Result:
- I did all of these because I felt that someone had to step up 
- I knew other team leader were recognized for their effort, but I was merely running everything in the backgound as the defactor team lead
- As a result, my team got back on track
- Our montly security compliance were on the good
- We met our deadlines with our product owners

### Lesson:
- I did not complain eventhough I was not recognized as the team lead
- I just worked harder and maintained what I was doing
- Eventually I got recognized but for a long time, I did it because I felt that it was the right thing to do
