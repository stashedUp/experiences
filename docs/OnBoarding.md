# How do you onboard new employees?How do you mentor new employees?

### Situation:
- My passion has always been teaching. 
- I enjoy teaching. In fact, I’ve considered being a professor when I retire. 
- At my current company, we didn’t have a methodical way to onboard new employees. 
- As a result, it took a long time for the new employees to start adding value to the company.

### Problem:
- The problem was that no technical person wanted to spend time onboarding a new employee. 
- The most onboarding happens at the HR level. 
- The technical people were not good at training. 
- Training requires skills and patients

### Solution:
- I realized that this is a problem. 
- So, I took the initiative to create a comprehensive onboarding program. 
- When a new employee joins, he/she would be required to complete this 5 week program. 
- I design the program in a way that will prepare the new employee to transition to real work easier. 
- In my program, the new employee starts at the basic level - such as uploading a static site from a repo to S3. 
- The head fake of this first project is that the employee would need to contact other people to get access to repos and accounts. 
- It’s a head fake because uploading a static website is a non-trivial task but getting the right access to required repos can be daunting. 
- The next project is building a monolith application, followed by microservices. 
- Each week, an experienced member of my team will also present to the new employee the tech stack that we use. 
- For example, my presentation was CI/CD and jenkins. 
- Someone else presented about infrastructure as code and terraform.

### Impact:
- As a result of this initiative, new members can add value sooner to our projects and transition to real work easily.

### Lesson:
- From this initiative, I have learnt that it is better to invest the time creating a comprehensive onboarding project rather than simply asking the new employee to shadow senior employees in the long run. 
- It’s methodical and we can work on a baseline to improve the program.
